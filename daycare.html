		<p><em>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;Play is the highest form of research.&quot;</em> ―&nbsp;Albert&nbsp;Einstein.<br><br>
		We let the children learn by playing. We believe that the little buds feel at home when given a freedom to play around. Also, we concentrate more on safety to the child when they are with the toys. To cater to the child's growth, we group our toddlers in three categories based on their ages and provide them appropriate education.<br><br>

		<em>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;Learning never exhausts the mind.&quot;</em> ―&nbsp;Leonardo&nbsp;Da&nbsp;Vinci<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Our infant centers have been designed for maximum efficiency, security and safety. Toys are sterilized daily. Your child will have a home feel in our center. We avoid the habit of using diaper because the frequent use of diaper will cause to rashes. In a warm and nurturing environment, our babies are cuddled, rocked and played with by carefully chosen caregivers.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Each caregiver is dressed in clean, colorful hospital scrubs. For the protection of each baby, we do not allow street shoes and every adult must sanitize their hands before entering our infant center.Play is based on exploration, stimulation and sensory. Music plays a big part in this adorable nursery.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Music,is played in the infant center daily. Recent studies have shown the enhanced effect of music on babies. They say music unlocks the creative spirit and strengthens the mind<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Every detail has been meticulously planned from the design of the infant center to the selection of equipment, toys, curriculum and activities to the screening and training of infant caregivers. Parents can rely on our loving, dedicated staff of infant caregivers, chosen for their warmth and affectionate personalities. They provide nurturing, age appropriate stimulation and lots of love.<br></p>

		<em>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;Children have to be educated, but they have also to be left to educate themselves.&quot;</em> ―&nbsp;Ernest&nbsp;Dimnet<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;At The Toddlers Zone our energetic, caring teachers encourage and gently guide each toddler through exploration and discovery.Your toddler's day will be filled with a plethora of activities, music, movement, fitness, toys and equipment that encourage exploration and discovery.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Our age appropriate outdoor playground offers plenty of opportunities for running, jumping and climbing. Soothing music and gentle backrubs during naptime give just the right repose for sleeping.Toddlers are striving for independence and have reached a child's first real milestone. They have grown into the mobile stage and are walking and exploring their fascinating environment.Their curiosity is endless! The Toddler's natural inquisitiveness is encouraged and nurtured.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Since Toddlers learn through play and exploration, we give them the space, age appropriate materials and stimulation they need to help quench their thirst for exploration. There are plenty of toys, equipment, art supplies, blocks and books. There is always lots of love given to all by our Toddler staff.<br></p>

		<p id="p3"><h3>FOR EARLY CHILDHOODS</h3><h4>AGE : Between 2 YEARS and 2.5 YEARS</h4>
		<em>&emsp;&emsp;&quot;Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.&quot;</em> ―&nbsp;Margaret&nbsp;Mead<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;We don't waste a minute of our play group time because there is so much to learn and so much fun to have!<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;They are now independent, curious and into lots of exploration. Toys, equipment and programs are designed to encourage discovery and learning.This begins first thing in the morning with circle time, the first activity is social participation.Up until now most of the play has been independent.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;A strong focus at this stage is potty training, which includes often asking if they have to go to the restroom and before you know it you have a potty trained child. At The Learning Experienc, our Twaddler program is the next stage of development following our Toddler program.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Twaddlers have expanded their language skills and can communicate verbally. At this stage independence dominates and exploration is their number one priority and children grow and develop very quickly.<br></p>
